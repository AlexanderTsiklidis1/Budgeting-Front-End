# Alexander Tsiklidis' CRUD Budgeting App
Hello, and welcome to my CRUD Budgeting App. In the backend of this app we have some raw data from a users monthly expenses and income. We link this data and the server that stores it to this repository/front-end so that we may create a budgeting application for our users.
